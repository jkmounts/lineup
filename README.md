# Lineup
This repository is being to host a project for my Code Louisville course.
The lineup site will give users the ability to create a Starting 11 for Racing Louisville Football Club.

## Goals
1. Show a starting lineup with positions and player names.
2. In mobile views, each players position and name should occupy its own row.
3. In desktop view, I would like photos of the players to appear and maybe additional info like hometown or college.
4. In desktop view, I would also like to explore making players appear in a chosen starting formation as they would lineup on a soccer pitch.
5. Allow site users to select which player appears in which position, so that they may create their own lineups. 
6. ?Export lineup in some type of image file so users can post to social media? - Not sure how feasible this is.

##Contributions
If anyone stumbles upon this repo, I am open to any tips or suggestions as this is a learning project for me. Thanks!
